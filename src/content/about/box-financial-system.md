Our current financial system is mainly debt-based which means that digital payments are simply transfers of claims between financial institutions.

Such transfers have shown to be efficient and practical payment methods. Nonetheless, unbanked and underbanked people canâ€™t join this system as many of them do not have a government-issued ID and/or money.
