## What is the Trustlines Network?

The Trustlines Network is a community-driven project that empowers people to create their own money and access digital payments. This is called People Powered Money.

To enable People Powered Money, we are building a universally accessible payment system. It allows people to make and receive payments without the burden of linking a bank account, or depositing any money upfront.
