## Accessible Technology

Developers are encouraged to build their own applications on top of the Protocol. For example, check out the white-label Trustlines App.

The Trustlines Protocol is the blockchain-based technology stack that brings People Powered Money to life. Using secure, decentralized blockchain technology is important to ensure that Trustlines remains accessible to everyone.
