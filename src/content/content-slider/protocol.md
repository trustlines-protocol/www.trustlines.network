## Accessible Technology

The Trustlines Protocol is a blockchain-based technology stack that brings People Powered Money to life. Using secure, decentralised blockchain technology is important to ensure that Trustlines remains accessible to everyone.

Developers are encouraged to build their own applications on top of the Protocol. As an example, check out the white-label [Trustlines App](https://trustlines.app).
