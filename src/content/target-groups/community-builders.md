A Trustlines community can thrive with just a handful of people. Get started by simply creating trustlines with a couple of friends. If you want to expand your outreach, there are plenty of resources available.

You can utilize and co-create a [Community Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nnam5NRBxbVqMJ7GrCcldSoFEtf1urMsZt63jfwS644/edit#), take a leadership role and apply for a grant, or connect with others passionate about People Powered Money.
