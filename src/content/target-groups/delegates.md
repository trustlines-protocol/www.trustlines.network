The Trustlines Blockchain is designed to be available at an extremely low-cost. However, certain fees are required to keep the blockchain running.

Since blockchain fees are paid with a native cryptocurrency, and handling it is difficult for most users, delegates are needed to pay these fees on behalf of users. Delegates may offer this for free in support of their community, or can be reimbursed using Trustlines.
