The open source Trustlines Protocol is composed of four main components - the Trustlines Blockchain, the relay servers, the smart contract system, and the client library. All components are easy to access on GitHub and developers are encouraged to build their own applications on top of the Protocol. Check out the developer portal and give it a try!
